## Earthquake Data Visualization
### Overview
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data.\
The objective for this project was development of an interactive map that would gather and plot 7-days of USGS earthquake data in realtion to earthquake location, magnitude, and depth. The interactive map in particular, showcases tectonic plate outlines and allows the user to select regional specific markers detailing seismic activity data.
