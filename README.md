## Earthquake Data Visualization
This challenge focuses on visualizing earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal is to create an interactive map using Leaflet.js that plots earthquake locations based on their longitude and latitude. The visualization will represent earthquake magnitude through marker size and depth through color intensity. Users can click on markers to view additional details, and a legend will provide context for the data. This project helps USGS better communicate seismic activity to the public and government agencies, supporting education and funding efforts.
